# n steps to reach the top. Can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time(k=2). 
# What is number of distinct ways to get to the top?

# Objective Function: number of distinct ways to get to the ith stair
# Base cases: f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=2
# Recursive relation: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
# Bottom-up
# Answer will be in the last element
